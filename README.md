# MIT Tech Review puzzle Y2018

The Jan/Feb 2018 edition of MIT's Technology Review has the following puzzle in the Puzzle Corner:

**Y2018.** How many integers from 1 to 100 can you form using the digits 2, 0, 1, and 8 exactly once each, along with the operators +, -, * (multiplication), / (division), and Ë† (exponentiation)? We desire solutions containing the minimum number of operators; among solutions having a given number of operators, those using the digits in the order 2, 0, 1, 8 are preferred. Parentheses may be used; they do not count as operators. A leading minus sign, however, does count as an operator.

The puzzle can be found at https://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/tr/.

This code is a brute force solution written in Python.
