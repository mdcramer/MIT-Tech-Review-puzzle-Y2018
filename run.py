Y2018. How many integers from 1 to 100 can you form using the 
digits 2, 0, 1, and 8 exactly once each, along with the operators 
+, -, * (multiplication), / (division), and Ë† (exponentiation)? We 
desire solutions containing the minimum number of operators; 
among solutions having a given number of operators, those using 
the digits in the order 2, 0, 1, 8 are preferred. Parentheses may 
be used; they do not count as operators. A leading minus sign, 
however, does count as an operator.
